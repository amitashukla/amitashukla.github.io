Engineering ethics increasingly requires that we stay conscientious of human psychological tendencies in creating new forms of interaction.
An examination and recommendations in the form of a policy white paper.">

See how American youth from across the country respond to infographics compiled from the best data available online about their hometowns. 
What do the data capture, and what do they miss?">

I contributed to reports on Chinese AI capabilities for the American Task Force on Innovation and for the White House Office of Science. ">

Oftentimes when they return to civilian life, they lack marketable skills and struggle to break free of the same toxis forces that left them incarcerated in the first place. Through the Rikers Coding Project, a collaborative of Columbia and Barnard students, I have participated in teaching women inmates of Rikers coding and entrepreneurial skills. ">

Interactive Maps" data-description="When new diplomats in the Department of State deploy, they receive extensive training in that particular country, but have not received extensive training in the overall region. Regional trends and anomalies can thus be harded to pick up on. I designed a proof-of-concept prototype using D3 and the CIA Factbook to populate interactive maps of each region so diplomats can compare and contrast regions by different characteristics such as literacy rates, racial proportions, and access to the internet.">

Along with other students from the organization Design for America, I attempted to redefine college planning for underserved youth in Harlem, partnering with the Harlem Education Activities Fund and its students.

						<a href="http://cargocollective.com/jaimemartinez/" data-largesrc="images/portf9.jpg" data-title="Junction: Safer Crosswalks" data-description="After conducting multiple interviews with visually impaired city-dwellers, I was struck that they consistently cite one major impediment to having the active city lifestyle they would like: navigating busy intersections. Some cities have begun outfitting crosswalks with audio signaling, but this hasn't happened fast enough to significantly change people's lifestyles. Junction is an app prototype to geolocate people when they reach crosswalks and integrate with stoplight systems to count down audibly how long users have to wait or have left to cross. ">

						<a href="http://cargocollective.com/jaimemartinez/" data-largesrc="images/portf8.jpg" data-title="U.N. Harmony with Nature" data-description="When it comes to international environmental law, policymakers around the world are not always deeply informed about relevant science. The United Nations Harmony with Nature Initiative seeks to address that through creating a platform for scientists and policymakers to have a virtual dialogue and exchange white papers. 
I contributed to the design and the development of this platform, which has contributed to over 15 international legal standards being passed since its inception.">

I designed this wearable device that logs pollution exposure throughout the course of a day to help them lobby lawmakers about unsafe air in their neighborhood.">

						<a href="http://cargocollective.com/jaimemartinez/" data-largesrc="images/portf6.jpg" data-title="Equal Solar" data-description="Partnering with a Harlem organization called WeACT for Environmental Justice, I proposed a design for a backpack-mounted solar charger to help inform local residents about the power of solar energy. This was a first step in a project to help them lower their energy costs through a power purchase agreement (PPA).">

Using Gephy to parse network data, I observed the most powerful players in the Enron scandal. ">

						<a href="http://cargocollective.com/jaimemartinez/" data-largesrc="images/portf2.jpg" data-title="Prosthetic Hand" data-description="As children with missing fingers or hands grow, they need new prosthetics every year at least. However, a traditional prosthetic can cost up to $15000 USD, making this financially impossible for most families. 
Enter eNABLE, an organization that works with volunteers to build and distribute hands for children. As president of my robotics team, I began an initiative to use our Makerspace to print hands for growing kids.">

						<a href="http://cargocollective.com/jaimemartinez/" data-largesrc="images/portf1.jpg" data-title="Paper Based Sensors" data-description="Leak detection in the pharmaceutical industry is quite literally a billion dollar problem. Current methods
of sensing leaks are costly and often cannot identify the precise location of a leak. This is a novel method to identify leaks as small as <.2mL with origin accuracy of 1 square mm and cost per square foot of about 2 cents.">
